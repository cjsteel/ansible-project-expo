# Ansible Expo

## Summary

Ansible expo provides a framework for managing a diverse parc of systems using Ansible and other tools.

The project is designed to allow for repository base private or public group and per system configurations.

### Goals

An open source project that allows for Infrastructure as Code (IoC) and is able to produce consistent and maintainable documented system configurations.

### Ideals

* Allow for (private) configuration data to be hosted in private repositories
* Include testing (public) configuration data with "real world" examples
* Incoporate open source roles that allow for universal configuration targets
  * That said, currently project testing is done primarily using the latest LTS versions of Ubuntu LTS and CentOS
* Allow Systems Administrators and knowledgable individuals to maintain a parc of one or more networked systems
* Incorporate opensource roles that work well and best exemplify these ideals
* When desirable to apply modifications to roles in distinct (cloned) repositories
* Continual incorporation of best practices
* Fast, easy to understand secure setup
* Fast, easy to understand secure deployments and orchestration
